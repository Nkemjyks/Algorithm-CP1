Problem: write an algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine
    The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
    The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
    The number of vowels in the sentence.

Solution:
1. create the function to solve the Problem.
2. declare three(3) variables for character length, no. of words, and no of vowels.
3. use legth property to get the character length
4. split sentence using space to obtain number of words using length property
5. iterate use match/filter methods to get vowels
